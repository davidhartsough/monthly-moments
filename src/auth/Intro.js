          <strong>Welcome!</strong> This app is a minimal yet meaningful social
          platform for you and your friends to share amazing moments with each
          other â€” one month at a time.
        </p>

          <strong>How Monthly Moments works</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          It's like a monthly newsletter; everyone writes about Moments from
          their lives throughout each month, and then at the beginning of the
          next month, all of those Moments are shared out to their friends.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Examples of Moments</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Generally, Moments capture the the parts of your life that you want to
          share with your friends, including:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Major life events, milestones</li>
          <li>Events you went to or were a part of</li>
          <li>Happenings, life updates, changes</li>
          <li>Projects, accomplishments, achievements</li>
          <li>
            Activities and things you enjoyed, spent time with, or found
            meaningful
          </li>
          <li>Media, entertainment, games, movies, books</li>
        </ul>
