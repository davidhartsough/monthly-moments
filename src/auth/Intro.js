          <strong>Welcome!</strong> This app is a minimal yet meaningful social
          platform for you and your friends to share amazing moments with each
          other â€” one month at a time.

          <strong>How Monthly Moments works</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          It's like a monthly newsletter; at the beginning of each month,
          everyone's Moments from the last month will be shared with their
          friends. So during each month, everyone writes down Moments from the
          current month that will be shared with their friends at the start of
          the next month.
        </p>
        <p>
